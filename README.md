# engines.vscode-lint

An npm package which tells you what minimum version of vscode your extension needs to run (based on parts of the API used).

## Installation

## Usage

> **Note**: For the sake of simplicity (and my sanity), this extension assumes you are using at least `1.63.0` as that is the version required for pre-release versions of extenions.
